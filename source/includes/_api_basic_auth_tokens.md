The following sections outline how to create and manage Basic Auth tokens in the BigCommerce control panel.

<span class="aside-warning-hd">Limited Support for Basic Auth </span><br><br>
BigCommerce is gradually deprecating Basic Authentication. Apps must use <a href="#building-oauth-apps">OAuth</a> to access our v3 API.   
Even within the v2 API, apps relying on Basic Authentication cannot access some features. (For example, the Webhooks resource requires OAuth.) Also, apps intended for sale on the BigCommerce App Marketplace must use OAuth.
