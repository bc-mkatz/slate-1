The BigCommerce control panel's new **Advanced Settings** > **API Accounts** option allows you to directly generate and revoke OAuth tokens and their associated user accounts. For details on using these new options with your apps, please see our new documentation on <a href="/api/#cp_oauth_get" target="_blank">Obtaining OAuth Tokens</a>. 


### <span class="jumptarget"> Stencil: New template Property Replaces Deprecated template_file </span>

BigCommerce has deprecated the Stencil themes platform's global `template_file` property. Its replacement is a new `template` property, which returns correct page types for custom template files. To pick up this correction, you must update your Stencil CLI installation. For details and links, please see the <a href="https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/release-notes" target="_blank">Stencil framework release notes</a>.

### <span class="jumptarget"> Stencil Cornerstone 1.4.2 Theme Released </span>

### <span class="jumptarget"> Order Shipments > shipping_provider Usage Clarified </span>

We have updated our documentation on the Order Shipment <a href="/api/v2/#blog-posts-object-properties" target="_blank">object</a>, and <a href="/api/v2/#create-a-shipment" target="_blank">Create a Shipment endpoint</a>, to clarify that the `shipping_provider` property is effectively required in `POST` requests. (You should include the property, even as an empty string, to prevent the unexpected default behavior described in the documentation.)

### <span class="jumptarget"> Blog Posts > published_date Usage Clarified </span>

We have updated our documentation on the Blog Posts <a href="/api/v2/#blog-posts-object-properties" target="_blank">object</a>, and its <a href="/api/v2/#create-a-blog-post" target="_blank">POST</a> and <a href="/api/v2/#update-a-blog-post" target="_blank">PUT</a> endpoints, to clarify the usage of this API's `published_date` property. Although `published_date` is returned as an object in responses, your `POST` and `PUT` requests should supply it as a flat date string in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.3" target="_blank">RFC 2822</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a> format.
