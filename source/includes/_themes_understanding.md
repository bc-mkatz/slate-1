Themes allow you to customize the look and feel of BigCommerce stores. The compelling store designs in the <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/showcase/" target="_blank">BigCommerce&#160;Showcase</a> demonstrate the kinds of things that can be done.

To ensure that your themes make the most of BigCommerceâ€™s extensive out-of-the-box features and capabilities, please be aware of all the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/all/" target="_blank">supported features</a> that store owners manage and maintain through the BigCommerce control panel.

You can ask further questions, and seek advice, in the <a href="https://forum.bigcommerce.com/s/group/0F913000000HLjECAW" target="_blank">Developer Forum</a>.
