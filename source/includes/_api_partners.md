# <span class="jumptarget" id="joinappmkt"> Joining the App Marketplace </span>

The following sections outline the steps required to become a vendor of <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/single-click-apps/" target="_blank">Single-Click Apps</a> on the BigCommerce platform. Doing so requires a partnership application, but acceptance will authorize you to provide best-of-breed solutions to the fast-growing online businesses we host.

## <span class="jumptarget"> Apply to the Technology Partner Program </span>

Before you can submit an app to the BigCommerce Marketplace, you must become an official Partner. BigCommerce offers app developers free sandbox stores through its Technology Partner Program. You can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/signup" target="_blank">apply for a technology partnership here</a>. To be approved as a partner, you will need:

* A website.
* Intent to offer your app publicly.
* Ability to support users of your app.
* Evidence of expertise in app development.

<aside class="notice">
<span class="aside-notice-hd">Notes</span><br>
  <ul>
	<li>If you are an existing BigCommerce partner, you do <em>not</em> need to re-apply for the Technology Partner Program.</li>
	<li>The email address you use in the partnership application form must be the same email address as you use to log into your sandbox store, and to log into <a href="//devtools.bigcommerce.com" target="_blank">My&#160;Apps</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

Once approved, you will receive one or more emails listing your partner credentials and next steps. Your Partner username and ID will be required to submit your app for <a href="https://developer.bigcommerce.com/" target="_blank">App Store</a> consideration.

<aside class="notice">
<span class="aside-notice-hd">Note</span>

  <ul>
	<li>If you do not receive these credentials by email, please contact <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.
	</li>
  </ul>
</aside>


## <span class="jumptarget"> Create a Sandbox Store </span>

To open your sandbox store, log into the Partner Portal, then click **Create a Trial Store**. 

When you log into your new store, use the same email that you used when applying to become a Technology Partner.

<aside class="notice">
<span class="aside-notice-hd">Trial Stores Don't Expire</span><br><br>
Although the <strong>Create a Trial Store</strong> option's name indicates that the store might be temporary, your store is actually permanent.
</aside>


## <span class="jumptarget"> Create Your Draft App </span>

Once you’re ready to start on your app, navigate to the Developer Portal home page, select the **My Apps** link, and log in using the same email address you've used for your sandbox store.

The **My Apps** page is where you will add, edit, and manage any of your BigCommerce Single-Click Apps. Start by clicking **Create an app**, and initiating <a href="/api/#app-registration">registration of your app</a>. (You can always come back to edit your draft app's name and other details later.)

Once your draft app is created, you will be able to install and test it privately in your sandbox store.
 
<aside class="notice">
<span class="aside-notice-hd">Note</span>
	<br><br>
To access your draft app in the store, make sure the email address you enter for your sandbox store’s <strong>Owner</strong> is identical to the email address you use for the BigCommerce Developer Portal. </ul>
</aside>

## <span class="jumptarget"> App Guidelines and Client Libraries </span>

For details on designing and building your app, please see [Building Apps with OAuth](#using-oauth-intro).

To facilitate app development on the BigCommerce platform, we provide [client libraries](#client-libraries) in a variety of popular programming languages.

## <span class="jumptarget"> Submit Your App </span>

Once your app is fully functional, and meets all of BigCommerce’s <a href="#app-store-approval-requirements">approval requirements</a>, submit the app from **My Apps**. We will get back to you as soon as we have reviewed your submission.
