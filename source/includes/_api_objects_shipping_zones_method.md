# <span class="jumptarget"> Shipping Methods Reference </span>

The Shipping Methods object and endpoints manage shipping rules within [Shipping Zones](#shipping-zones-reference). These rules determine the shipping rates displayed at checkout, and related parts of the control panel, such as the shipping of manual orders.


## <span class="jumptarget"> Shipping Method Object – Properties </span>

A Shipping Method object represents a shipping method enabled within the store.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | int | Shipping-method ID. |
| name | string | Display name for shipping method. |
| type | string | Shipping-method type. The currently supported static/fixed shipping-quote types are [`perorder`](#perorder), [`peritem`](#peritem), [`weight`](#weight), or [`total`](#total). We plan to later add support for these dynamic/real-time shipping-quote types: `auspost`, `canadapost`, `endicia`, `usps`, `fedex`, `royalmail`, `ups`, `upsready`, or `upsonline`. |
| settings | object | Depends on the shipping-method `type`. See the supported `settings` object models [here](#settingstypes). |
| enabled | boolean | Whether or not this shipping-zone method is enabled. |
| handling_fees | object | Handling-fee information for this method. This object currently contains the following element: <br> `fixed_surcharge`: the handling fee. |
