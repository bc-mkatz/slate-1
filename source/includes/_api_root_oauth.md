# <span class="jumptarget"> <a name="using-oauth-intro"></a> Building Apps with OAuth </span>

OAuth apps (also known as public apps or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/single-click-apps/" target="_blank">Single-Click Apps</a>) can be listed in the App Store for easy installation in all BigCommerce stores. They&#160;use OAuth to obtain an access token and to communicate with the central BigCommerce API endpoint. 

## <span class="jumptarget"> About Single-Click Apps </span>

Building an OAuth app is the recommended approach in almost all cases. BigCommerce plans to deprecate the alternative Basic Auth mechanism that currently supports [private apps](/api/#building-basic-auth-apps) for individual stores.

Before you start building an app for the App Store, we suggest reviewing the [App Store acceptance requirements](#app-store-approval-requirements). To start making API requests, you'll need a [Client ID and Client&#160;Secret](#app-registration), and an [OAuth token](#app-installation-and-update-sequence).

<span class="aside-notice-hd">Draft App Option</span><br><br>
You can also create a “Draft” version of a Single-Click App, for use only in your store. You don't need to submit this Draft app for publishing in the App Store.

### <span class="jumptarget"> API Endpoint </span>

Public API requests are protected by TLS, and use the following base URI: `https://api.bigcommerce.com`. The exact paths are noted in the Reference section for each resource. 

### <span class="jumptarget"> Request Headers </span>

Public API requests are authenticated by the following HTTP headers: 

* `X-Auth-Client`: the **Client ID**. To get your **Client ID**, you must complete [App Registration](#registration). 
* `X-Auth-Token`: the OAuth token. To get your OAuth token, you must complete [App Installation](#app-registration). 

In addition, while not all resources require the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers, many do. To ensure that your calls succeed, always include these headers. 

### <span class="jumptarget"> Managing Users' Session Timeouts </span>

We recommend that you add BigCommerce's JavaScript SDK to your Single-Click Apps, to protect your apps' users from getting logged out of the BigCommerce control panel after a period of idleness. To include our SDK, add this script tag to your Single-Click App: 

```html
<script src="//cdn.bigcommerce.com/jssdk/bc-sdk.js">
```

Optionally, you can pass a logout callback function within the initialization call:

```js
BigCommerce.init({
      onLogout: callback
});
```

This callback function will run when the user explicitly logs out of the BigCommerce control panel, or is automatically logged out. The callback will allow your app to respond to this logout.


### <span class="jumptarget"> Monetizing Your App </span>

If you want to charge merchants for your app, please note that BigCommerce expects you to handle the billing aspects of the transaction. Your app needs to take care of collecting the fee from the merchant. 

Under the standard contract, within 30 days of collecting this revenue, you must send BigCommerce 20% and retain the remaining 80% for yourself. Once your app is published, a mandatory revenue-share reporting form will be sent to the primary contact on your partner account, at the beginning of each month.

### <span class="jumptarget"> Private Apps with OAuth? </span>

Some private apps use OAuth. Please note that:

* Such apps will normally be accessible only to stores belonging to the user who created the app in the Developer Portal.

* To be shareable with other stores, these apps must be approved and published in the App Store.
